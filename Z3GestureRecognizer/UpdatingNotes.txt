- PreposeGestureRecognizer - UI application based on a Kinect sample
	- requires BigRationalLibrary for Z3 manipulation
	- requires ICSharpCode.AvalonEdit for UI color highlighting and completion of Prepose text (open source library)
	- Microsoft.Z3 
	- also as part of the build, native DLLs are copied 
		- copy "$(SolutionDir)External\x64\libz3.dll" "$(OutDir)libz3.dll"
		- copy "$(SolutionDir)External\x64\Kinect20.dll" "$(OutDir)Kinect20.dll" // TODO
	- CustomHighlighting.xshd contains highlighting for Prepose
	- Can hit an exception parsing XAML if you're lacking the rigth Kinect SDK

- PreposeGestures - library for parsing, Z3 compilation and for safety testing and static analysis and runtime support

- To regenerate the grammar, update the hard-coded path in build.bat and run it. You'll need to have Java JRE installed on you machine, because ANTLR depends on it.
